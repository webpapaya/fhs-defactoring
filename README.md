# Defactoring exercise

This coding kata/exercise is inspired by the refucktoring session at CodeFreeze https://trello.com/c/izhDXJcH/70-1600-refucktoring-session-kammi-ravintola

- We'll start with a completely tested coding kata.
- We'll make the code worse while the tests still pass.
- We'll make the code even worse.

# Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:webpapaya/fhs-defactoring.git
npm install
npm run test -- --watch
# Make the code as bad as possible!!!
```
